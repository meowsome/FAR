                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>FAR was formed in 2019 and has been growing steadily since. Originally part of the Prestona Furs group, which included students from both the Prescott and Daytona ERAU campuses, we are now our own independent group. We have around 50 members consisting of active students and alumni. We are not a RSO.</p>
